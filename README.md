0x11. C - printf Team project

Write a function that produces output according to a format
Handle the following conversion specifiers
With a face like mine, I do better in print
What one has not experienced, one will never understand in print
Nothing in fine print is ever good news
My weakness is wearing too much leopard print
How is the world ruled and led to war? Diplomats lie to journalists and believe these lies when they see them in print
The big print gives and the small print takes away
Sarcasm is lost in print
